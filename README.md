# Code for the winner of TAO 2020

## Note: 

This repo is **NOT** a fully reinplementation of our submitted result([mAP@27.46](https://motchallenge.net/results/TAO_Challenge/)). 

Instead, two models for appearance modeling are included, together with the open-source [BAGS](https://github.com/FishYuLi/BalancedGroupSoftmax) model and the full set of code for inference. 
With this code, you can achieve around mAP@23 with TAO test set (based on our estimation).

# Start from here:

Please find instructions for the detection model in [tao_detection_release/README.md](tao_detection_release/README.md) and the tracking model in [tao_tracking_release/README.md](tao_tracking_release/README.md)

# Result fileï¼š

The result for the TAO validation set can be downloaded in [TAO_val](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NGLcQ40ci2MfbJK34hq37mv9iTOXV2sh/view?usp=sharing).
